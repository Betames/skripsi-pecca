Here is the procedure to use this application:

1. Click "Pages" menu to choose which algorithm that you want to use for encryption and decryption.

2. After choose the algorithm, the system will navigate you to encryption and decryption page of the algorithm.

3. Text file's format that can be use in this application is .txt.

4. Before doing encryption or decryption, you have to input text file first by click "Input Text" button.

5. In Elliptic Curve Cryptography page, before doing encryption or decryption, you have to input a key field first. This field must be filled by integer between 0 and 65538. Same key is used for encryption and decryption.

6. After succeeding the encryption or decryption process, you can save the result text.

7. When you choose "Others" menu, you can choose:
   a} "About" submenu to view About page
   b} "Help" submenu to view Help page
